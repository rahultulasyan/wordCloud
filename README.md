# wordCloud

Hello people,

My name is Rahul Tulasyan and this yet another small project in Python.

This a Word Cloud (a collage, if you will) generation script in Python.
This script takes a text file as input and tries to form a wordCloud image
using the importance and frequency of the word in the file.

I have used wordcloud module to implement this.
I also used matplotlib module to display the image.
